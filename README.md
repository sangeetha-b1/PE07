Input:
Users may now add a country name and currency to the improved Cities App by using the new AddCountry screen.  This enables users to add several nations and the currencies that go with them using an easy-to-use form.

Process:
The data is verified and saved in the app's state once the user submits the form.  The uuid library is used to assign a distinct ID to every nation.  The application navigates between screens using React Native's useState or component state (via this.state) and navigation.  A shared list that may be accessed from other areas of the application receives the input.

Output:
The list of saved nations and their corresponding currencies are shown on the Countries screen.  When a new nation is introduced, this output is updated dynamically.  The program adheres to sound modular design principles and is well-structured with tab-based navigation.
